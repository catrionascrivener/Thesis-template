To add a new chapter, create a new file in the chapters folder. Then in your main text file (main.tex), add a new section. 

% In this example, we add chapter X:

% CHAPTER X
% \chapter{Chapter X title}
% \input{Chapters/ChapterX.tex}

% Any lines beginning with the percentage symbol will not be included in the compiled version
