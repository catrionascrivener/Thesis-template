# Thesis-template

Here you will find the template for a PhD thesis created in Overleaf. 
As I am a Psychology student, this was created with APA formatting and referencing.

To use it, click on the button 'clone or download', and 'download ZIP'.
Go to Overleaf at www.overleaf.com (and create an account if you don't already have one).
Click on 'new project' and then 'upload project'.
Navigate to the 'Thesis-template-master' ZIP file that downloaded onto your computer, or drag and drop it into the window.
Ta da! You can now work on your thesis using the template provided.



** More details **

In the left-hand navigation bar you will see two folders: 'chapters', and 'images'. You will also see a file called 'main.tex'.
The 'main.tex' file contains all of the preamble, where we tell Overleaf which packages to use and the settings for the document.
It also contains your chapter names, and provides a link to each chapter file.
The 'main.tex' file is also where we create the title page, and declare the name of the bibilopgraphy file.

Inside the 'chapter' folder, there is a separate .tex file for each chapter. 
This is where you write the main text for each chapter.
The folder 'images' is where you should upload any images that you want to use.

If you are new to LaTeX and Overleaf, I direct you to the Overleaf documentation page (https://www.overleaf.com/learn), which is very helpful.

At the moment this is a very simple template, and you will be able to find many more online.
If you would like me to add any other examples or explanations, feel free to ask!

Happy writing!
